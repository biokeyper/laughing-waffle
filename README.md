## **4. Developing Core Components**
### Detailed Steps:
1. **Bootloader:**
   - Use **U-Boot** for flexibility and ARM support.
   - Implement **secure boot** to prevent unauthorized OS modifications.

2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):**
   - Develop drivers for peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS).
   - Ensure HAL compatibility with multiple hardware platforms.

3. **Power Management:**
   - Implement **CPU frequency scaling** and **sleep states** for battery optimization.
   - Use **thermal throttling** to prevent overheating.

4. **Initialization Process:**
   - Use **systemd** or a custom init system for service management.
   - Parallelize startup tasks to reduce boot time.
